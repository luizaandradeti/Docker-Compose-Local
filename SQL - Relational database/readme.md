Let's say you want to develop a website and you need PHP, MySQL and PhpMyAdmin on your machine, this feature is free in Docker-Compose and does not access any server. If the website is successful, you can hire a plan and use the SaaS of a server that has these resources, in addition to 24-hour support, if you are a beginner developer and use SaaS because your company thought it was a good alternative.
